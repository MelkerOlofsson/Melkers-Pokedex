*THIS PROJECT IS NOT MADE FOR DESKTOP AS IT WASN'T A CRITERIA, AND THEREFORE IT'S NOT RESPONSIVE. IT'S MADE FOR CELLPHONES ONLY*

This project was made on my first year at IT-Högskolan in Gothenburg, Sweden. It was created as a project for my course in Native JavaScript.

The criterias that had to be met was the use of a fetch from a public API, and to display this fetched information in some way on the website. I chosed to make a Pokédex with the use of PokéAPI.

Some other criterias was to use Chart.js in any way, as well as being able to fetch, post, put, and delete from an API called 'Cities', which the school provided to us for educational use.
